This plugin provides installing, running and reporting code coverage with JaCoCo (http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)

At first you need to setup basic JaCoCo profile with:

jacoco setup

Then you can run tests to prepare code coverage agent:

jacoco run-tests --package com.example.model

Package parameter is required and here you specify classes for code coverage instrumentation. Command "run-tests" always runs all available tests.
You can also run Arquillian tests and in this case you are asked for container managed profile (JaCoCo with Arquillian currently works properly just for managed profiles).
Finally you can create report for above specified classes by:

jacoco create-report

Html code coverage report is available in ${project.build.directory}/site/jacoco/index.html


TODO
- create plugin test
- add command to view generated report
